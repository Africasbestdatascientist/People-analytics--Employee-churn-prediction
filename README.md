# People-analytics--Employee-churn-prediction
Using a dataset from IBM on employee churn, i created a predictive model to identify employees that are likely to churn. I believe in the era of big data, the use of ML and AI is inevitable in the running of every business. Every business unit needs to adopt ML in its operations, from sales to IT. While the use of ML is popular in some business units, its less applied in others especially in HR. Companies will save millions of dollars if they are able to reduce their employee turnover. Companies with low employee turnover naturally attracts talents into the company compared with companies with high turn over. Hence the need for companies units like HR to adopt the use of ML.
